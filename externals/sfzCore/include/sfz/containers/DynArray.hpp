// DynArray (interface)
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// A class managing a dynamic array, somewhat like std::vector
///
/// A DynArray has both a size and a capacity. The size is the current number of active elements
/// in the internal array. The capacity on the other hand is the number of elements the internal
/// array can hold before it needs to be resized.
///
/// DynArray guarantees that the elements are stored in a (32-byte aligned) contiguous array. It 
/// does, however, not guarantee that a specific element will always occupy the same position in
/// memory. When inserting elements or resizing the internal array objects (or the whole array)
/// may be moved to different memory locations without any copy or move constructors being called.
///
/// DynArray iterators are simply pointers to the internal array. Modifying a DynArray while
/// iterating over it will likely have unintended consequences if you are not very careful.
///
/// Every method in DynArray is declared noexcept. This means that if any constructor or
/// destructor called throws an exception the program will terminate by std::terminate().
