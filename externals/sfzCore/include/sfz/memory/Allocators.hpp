// sfzCore Allocator Interface
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// An sfzCore allocator is a non-instantiable class with the following interface:
//
// static void* allocate(size_t size, size_t alignment = 32) noexcept;
// static void* reallocate(void* previous, size_t newSize, size_t alignment = 32) noexcept;
// static void deallocate(void* pointer) noexcept;
//
// Loosely allocate() maps to malloc(), reallocate() to realloc() and deallocate() to free().
// See the standard allocator for more info on the requirements of each of these functions.
//
// Note that the noexcept specified is not optional, an sfzCore allocator may never throw
// exceptions. It may, however, during exceptional circumstances terminate the program.
